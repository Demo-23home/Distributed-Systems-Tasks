# Distributed Systems Tasks Repository README

## Overview

Welcome to the Distributed Systems Tasks repository! This repository contains projects related to distributed systems, including a UDP client-server Windows Form application and another project for TCP communication. These tasks are designed to help you understand and implement various concepts related to distributed systems. This README provides detailed information on the projects, how to set them up, and how to use them for learning purposes.

## Projects

### UDP Client-Server Windows Form App

The UDP client-server Windows Form application demonstrates communication between client and server using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). It showcases asynchronous communication and provides a graphical user interface for easy interaction.

### TCP Communication

The TCP communication project focuses on communication using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It explores features like reliable data transfer, flow control, and congestion control. The project is designed to help you understand the complexities of establishing and maintaining connections in a distributed system.

## Prerequisites

Before working with the projects in this repository, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Visual Studio:** The projects are developed using Visual Studio IDE. You can download it from the [official Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2.Open Projects in Visual Studio:
For the UDP client-server Windows Form app, open the solution file (UDPClientServer.sln) in Visual Studio.
For the TCP communication project, open the solution file (TCPCommunication.sln) in Visual Studio.

3.Usage
Each project folder contains its own README file with specific instructions on how to run and use the applications. Refer to the individual project's README for detailed usage guidelines.

4.Contributing
Contributions to the projects are welcome. If you find bugs or want to enhance the functionality, please follow these steps:
Fork the repository.
Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name.
Make your changes and commit them: git commit -m 'Add some feature'.
Push to the branch: git push origin feature/your-feature-name.
Create a pull request explaining your changes.
Please ensure that your code follows best practices and consider writing unit tests for the changes you introduce.

5.License
This project is licensed under the MIT License, allowing you to use, modify, and distribute the code for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

Happy coding and exploring distributed systems! üåêüöÄ
